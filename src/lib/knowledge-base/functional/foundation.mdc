# Functional Knowledge Base

## Mission

- Capture user journeys, business goals, and the value streams driving **{{projectName}}**.
- Model workflows as state machines, sequence diagrams, or decision tables where helpful.
- Document domain language (ubiquitous language) and maintain a living glossary.

## Expectations

1. Every feature or task must trace back to a functional objective in this directory.
2. When new functional insights emerge, create or update the relevant `.mdc` entry immediately.
3. Link technical counterparts in `../technical/` so the team can move between intent and implementation.
4. Keep `functional/index.mdc` current so contributors can discover existing knowledge at a glance.
5. Write every `.mdc` and `.md` file in English to keep the shared context accessible.
6. Curate a taxonomy of functional problems so future sessions can map work to recurring themes.

## Recommended Structure

- `functional/index.mdc` → table of contents with topical hierarchy.
- `functional/personas/` → personas, actors, their goals.
- `functional/workflows/` → user flows, BPMN diagrams, critical scenarios.
- `functional/policies/` → business rules, regulatory constraints, SLAs.
- `functional/taxonomy/` → canonical catalogue of business capabilities and recurring problem statements.

> Guidance for agents: preserve functional intent when suggesting changes. Never introduce a feature without mapping it to a documented functional requirement here.
