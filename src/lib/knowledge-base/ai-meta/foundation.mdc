# AI Meta Playbook

## Purpose

- Coordinate agent workflows for **{{projectName}}**.
- Define prompts, guardrails, and escalation paths shared by all contributors.
- Track session hygiene: how the persistency layer must be updated after each loop.

## Expectations

1. Every AI session starts via `ai-start.sh` so the environment is deterministic.
2. Agents must log new knowledge in `functional/` or `technical/` as appropriate—not here.
3. Record prompt archetypes, command recipes, and safe defaults for `{{agent}}`.
4. Curate `ai-meta/index.mdc` with links and descriptions for prompts, guardrails, and playbooks.
5. Ensure every `.mdc` or `.json` artifact in the persistency layer stays in English to support downstream consumers.
6. Track a taxonomy of agent playbooks and automation patterns so recurring tasks can be launched consistently.

## Recommended Structure

- `ai-meta/index.mdc` → overview of agent roles, tooling, escalation ladder.
- `ai-meta/prompts/` → reusable prompt templates and modifiers.
- `ai-meta/operations.mdc` → process checklist, Definition of Done, anti-drift cadence.
- `ai-meta/migration-brief.mdc` → automatically generated brief guiding the migration of existing layers.
- `ai-meta/taxonomy/` → inventory of agent behaviors, guardrails, and escalation scenarios.

> Guidance for agents: before executing tasks, review `ai-meta/migration-brief.mdc` (if present) and reconcile legacy conventions with this playbook. All new knowledge must respect the three-domain separation.
