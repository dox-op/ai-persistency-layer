# Migration Session Brief

> Generated automatically each time the CLI prepares a migration on **{{projectName}}**.

## Existing Layer

- Primary location: `{{existingLayer}}`
- Additional material to reconcile:
{{sourcesList}}

## Updated Knowledge Base Guardrails

- Preserve the current `.mdc` corpus; refine it instead of replacing it.
- Enforce English-only documentation.
- Keep `functional/index.mdc`, `technical/index.mdc`, and `ai-meta/index.mdc` aligned with on-disk content.
- Maintain the tri-domain separation and respect the recursive enrichment rule.
- Ensure `ai-start.sh` continues to launch the chosen agent with the persistency context.

## Supplemental Inputs

{{intakeNotes}}

## Directory Assessment

- Canonical domains missing prior to migration:
{{missingCanonical}}
- Additional directories referenced in the existing bootstrap:
{{referencedExtras}}
- Additional directories not referenced in the existing bootstrap (review before moving or archiving):
{{unreferencedExtras}}

## Agent Runbook (`{{agent}}`)

1. Load the existing layer and review the domain foundations.
2. Integrate the supplemental inputs above, annotating their origin in the domain indexes.
3. Confirm that additional directories remain discoverable via `ai-bootstrap.mdc` or archive them explicitly.
4. Update or create `.mdc` entries so every new insight is captured under the correct domain.
5. Summarise the migration outcome (changes applied, pending gaps, follow-ups) back into this brief or `_bootstrap.log`.
