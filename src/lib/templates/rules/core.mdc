# {{projectName}} · Persistency Rules

## Recursive Knowledge Updates

1. Treat every AI session as a knowledge acquisition loop.
2. When new facts emerge, update the relevant `.mdc` file immediately.
3. Prefer additive updates that preserve historical context.
4. Confirm that each update keeps functional, technical, and AI meta aspects in sync.

## Knowledge Taxonomy

- `knowledge/functional-*.mdc`: user journeys, business flows, domain constraints.
- `knowledge/technical-*.mdc`: architecture, modules, data flows, integration points.
- `knowledge/ai-meta-*.mdc`: prompts, command recipes, agent-specific instructions.

## Working Agreement

- Respect the separation between functional, technical, and AI meta areas.
- Avoid duplication: link to existing sections rather than restating.
- When referencing source code, tag files using relative paths.
- Keep indices updated to point to the canonical `.mdc` document for every topic.

## Session Hygiene

1. Start sessions through `ai-start.sh` to guarantee consistent environment variables.
2. Before finishing, run `scripts/ai/check-stale.ts` (if present) to detect drift.
3. Commit updates to the persistency layer with descriptive messages.

## Golden Rules

- Recursion: feeding new knowledge back into the layer is mandatory.
- Division: keep functional vs technical vs AI meta topics isolated.
- Spawner: `ai-start.sh` is the single entry point for agent sessions.
