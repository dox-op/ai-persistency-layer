## Agent Instructions

1. Read each source listed above to understand existing functional, technical, and AI-meta knowledge.
2. Migrate or refactor the material into the new tri-domain layout:
   - `functional/` for business context and workflows.
   - `technical/` for architecture and implementation notes.
   - `ai-meta/` for prompts, processes, and operational guardrails.
3. Remove or archive obsolete entries after the migration is committed.
4. Log the reconciliation outcome in `_bootstrap.log` with references to the updated files.

Do not proceed with new feature work until the legacy layer has been reconciled with the new structure.
