# Functional Knowledge Base

## Mission

- Capture user journeys, business goals, and the value streams driving **{{projectName}}**.
- Model workflows as state machines, sequence diagrams, or decision tables where helpful.
- Document domain language (ubiquitous language) and maintain a living glossary.

## Expectations

1. Every feature or task must trace back to a functional objective in this directory.
2. When new functional insights emerge, create or update the relevant `.mdc` entry immediately.
3. Link technical counterparts in `../technical/` so the team can move between intent and implementation.

## Recommended Structure

- `functional/index.mdc` → table of contents with topical hierarchy.
- `functional/personas/` → personas, actors, their goals.
- `functional/workflows/` → user flows, BPMN diagrams, critical scenarios.
- `functional/policies/` → business rules, regulatory constraints, SLAs.

> Guidance for agents: preserve functional intent when suggesting changes. Never introduce a feature without mapping it to a documented functional requirement here.
