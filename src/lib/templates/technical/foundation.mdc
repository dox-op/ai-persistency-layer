# Technical Knowledge Base

## Scope

- Architecture views, module boundaries, and integration contracts for **{{projectName}}**.
- Operational characteristics: deployment topologies, SLAs, observability signals.
- Constraints that influence implementation choices (tech debt, performance budgets, compliance).

## Expectations

1. Every code change must reference the relevant section in this directory.
2. Keep diagrams and dependency graphs close to the source; update or cross-link when components evolve.
3. Surface breaking changes quickly so functional owners can evaluate downstream impact.

## Recommended Structure

- `technical/index.mdc` → architecture map with links to deep dives.
- `technical/services/` → service/API docs, data schemas, messaging contracts.
- `technical/infrastructure/` → environments, pipelines, platform integrations.
- `technical/operations/` → runbooks, SLO/SLA definitions, alert strategies.

> Guidance for agents: when planning or implementing code, cite the section in this directory that authorizes the change and record any deviations.
